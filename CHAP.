81 - Kabali is a brave warrior who with his group of young ninjas moves from one place to another to
fight against his opponents.  Before Fighting he just calculates one thing,  the difference between his
ninja number and the opponent's ninja number.  From this difference he decides whether to fight or
not. Kabali's ninja number is never greater than his opponent.

Input
The input contains two numbers in every line.  These two numbers in each line denotes the number
ninjas in Kabali's clan and his opponent's clan or vice versa.  The input numbers are not greater
than 2^32. Input is terminated by `End of File'.

Output
For  each  line  of  input,  print  the  difference  of  number  of  ninjas  between  Kabali's  clan  and  his
opponent's clan.  Each output should be in seperate line.

83 - "ooooooooooooooh!
If I could do the easy mathematics like my school days!!
I can guarantee, that I'd not make any mistake this time!!"
Says a smart university student!!
But his teacher even smarter  "Ok!  I'd assign you such projects in your software lab.  Don't be so sad."
"Really!!"  the  students  feels  happy.   And  he  feels  so happy that he cannot see the smile in his teacher's face. The  rst project for the poor student was to make a calculator that can just perform the basic arithmetic operations. But like many other university students he doesn't like to do any project by himself.  He just wants to collect programs from here and there.  As you are a friend of him, he asks you to write the program.  But, you are also intelligent enough to tackle this kind of people.  You agreed to write only the (integer) division and mod (%) operations for him.

Input

Input  is  a  sequence  of  lines.   Each  line  will  contain  an  input  number.   One  or  more  spaces.   A  sign  ( division or  mod).   Again  spaces.   And  another  input  number.   Both  the  input  numbers  are  non- negative  integer.  

Output
A line for each input, each containing an integer.  See the sample input and output.  Output should not
contain any extra space.

SampleInput
110 / 100
99 % 10
2147483647 / 2147483647
